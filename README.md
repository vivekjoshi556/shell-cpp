This is a challenge to build a POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Learnings: shell command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

### Ideas:
- If we get to a point where there are many commands look into "Automatic Command Registration".
